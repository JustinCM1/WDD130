    <h3 class="review_text">Cuphead </h3>
    <p>The stunning animations, creative soundtrack, and fun story is enough to keep you playing this frustratingly hard game. Really though, it has to be one of the hardest games I have ever played before. There are only two types of levels in Cuphead. The most common level is where you take on a boss that usually has more than one stage while the other is a run and gun section where you take on hordes of enemies just trying to make it to the end. You HAVE to die multiple times just to memorize the attack patterns the bosses use. But when you do end up beating the boss you’ve been struggling on, the feeling will be so worth it. I definitely recommend playing this game. Not only will it be a fun experience, but you’ll grow your patience a ton.  </p>

    <h3 class="review_text">Attack on Titan  </h3>
    <p>Attack on Titan is PEAK FICTION. Everything about this show is incredible. The pacing, characters, story, powers, and the plot twists are what every show should aspire to be. What I really like about this show is that no one is ever safe. It’s a dangerous world and there’s no plot armor which means even if you’re a named character in the story, there’s not a guarantee that they’ll make it out alive. It makes the show a lot more impactful and fuller of suspense. It’s a story that will raise ethical questions on who in the show is right and who is wrong. And the thing is, it’s hard for me to decide myself. It’s one of my favorite shows of all time and it should be on everyone’s list of must-see shows.  </p>

    <h3 class="review_text">Full Metal Alchemist  </h3>
    <p>I loved seeing Edward and Alphonse Elric unravel one of the greatest mysteries of all time. As they begin to find one of the most powerful artifacts of alchemy, they begin to discover bigger things than not many people. The relationship between the brothers is so cool to see. Seeing how much they care about each other, and their well-being is sweet to watch. The story moves along really well without becoming overwhelmed with information. You start to feel big brained when you watch the show.  </p>

    <h3 class="review_text">Dragon Ball Z </h3>
    <p>I consider Dragon Ball to be like the grandfather of anime. It helped bring a lot of people into the anime scene since its popularity. I remember watching Dragon Ball growing up and liking it even if I didn’t know what anime was. The number of transformations is honestly a bit ridiculous, but the fights are always super hype. Goku is every gym bro’s physique goal including mine. Dragon Ball is a source of inspiration for a lot of shows and video games. The pure nostalgia helps make this one of my favorite shows ever.  </p>

    <h3 class="review_text">Demon Slayer </h3>
    <p>Demon Slayer is an incredible show. The art style is unique with the animation never lacking. The kind and thoughtful main character is a sigh of fresh air compared to the millions of dumb main characters that are seen in most anime. We see a mystery start to develop about Tanjiro, his family, and the ability he realizes that he has. It’s a cool sub mystery while they fight to find the main antagonist. The animation is top tier quality every episode. It’s really easy to appreciate even if you don’t like anime. </p>

    <h3 class="review_text">Invincible</h3>
    <p>Invincible is definitely not for the lighthearted. Imagine Superman going rouge and becoming a villain. That’s essentially what the plot of Invincible is all about. I always love an origin story show where we see a superhero finding and discovering the powers that he/she has and choosing for themselves what’s morally right.  </p>

    <h3 class="review_text">Pokémon</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite video game franchises of all time. I just have so many fond memories of getting the new game and making the perfect team to take on the champion of the region. The pure joy of finding and catching the coolest looking Pokémon is something that I love about the games. And based on the team that you have, I can automatically tell what kind of human you are. Way more accurate than any buzzfeed quiz you could ever take. Even as an adult, I still play Pokémon. Does this make me less of an adult? I’m not sure. Either way I don’t care, I’m having a blast.  </p>

    <h3 class="review_text">Star Wars</h3>
    <p>You have to respect how incredible Star Wars is. Even when “A New Hope” first came out in 1977, it was unlike anything that has been made so far. They did such a great job using practical effects to make the spaceships and lightsaber fights look amazing.  Along with the effects were great storytelling, engaging characters, and plot twists that surprised everyone. It even came up with the most misquoted saying in all of cinematic history. The famous “Luke, I am your father.” is actually “No, I am your father.” So next time your friend misquotes Darth Vader, you can correct them. I think George Lucas did a fantastic job building the world that takes in a galaxy far, far away. It’s a much watch for every human in existence.  </p>

    <h3 class="review_text">Mandalorian</h3>
    <p>As much as I love the Skywalker saga of Star Wars, I love it when we get to explore the new sides of the galaxy far, far away. The Mandalorian did a great job of doing so. We got to explore what the Mandalorian religion looks like and what life was like after the fall of the Empire. Also seeing Baby Yoda’s interactions was worth it by itself. However, I did find the plot of the shows to be a little too predictable. Usually, a problem occurs and the Mandalorian had to go somewhere to fix it while trying to keep Baby Yoda safe. Things would get crazy and either a friend they made during the episode would come and save them or Baby Yoda would use the force to save both. Even with this nitpicky opinion, I still enjoyed watching it. The ending, however, was great.  </p>

    <h3 class="review_text">Naruto</h3>
    <p>Honestly one of my favorite shows ever. Naruto does an excellent job with creating the world, building up the characters, showing off epic fights, and teaching the value of hard work. Naruto with his unforgiving and hard circumstances doesn’t care about the cards he’s been dealt with and chooses to work hard and become better. It’s a classic tale of the underdog which I’m a sucker for. I think that Naruto has some of the best arcs in all anime complete with tons of action and drama. Even though I like Naruto a lot, I think the filler episodes happen way too often. If you do decide to watch Naruto, I would recommend looking up a filler episode list on google to see which episodes to skip. But its a ten out of ten when it’s the canon episodes.  </p>

    <h3 class="review_text">Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
    <p>I really like this anime. The power of cursed techniques is still super confusing for me to understand but it looks super hype. For some reason, I really like the characters that are super overpowered. It just makes the anime have more of a more comedic tone to the show. One of my favorite characters of all time, Yuta is from Jujutsu Kaisen. It’s just a fun story with fun characters. Definitely should watch it when you get the chance.  </p>

    <h3 class="review_text">One Piece</h3>
    <p>One Piece is known for being one of the most difficult shows to watch because of its 1000 plus episodes. This fact scared me from watching it for the longest time. But eventually, with no more shows to watch, I decided to start watching. I will say, One Piece’s pacing is horrendous. It takes forever for anything to happen. But the story and world building is pretty good. Right now, the show is mid. But I’ve seen clips of the shows that are being made now and it looks super hype. So, I’m watching it now so I can get to the good stuff later. With One Piece being 1000 episodes, it is nice to always have something to watch.  </p>
